The history is about a samurai cat called Pepe. Once upon a time, Pepe was fishing by the river near his house and after 
a long time waiting he finally fished an _evil carp_. He was very happy because of the dinner he was about to have that night 
but in that moment, the _team rat_ band stole his carp and fade away.
